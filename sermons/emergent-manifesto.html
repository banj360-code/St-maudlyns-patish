        <p>The modern web is a <strong>Scattering</strong>. It is built of ghosts and ephemeral scripts that vanish the moment the power falters. They offer you 'frameworks' that weigh more than the stone of our bell tower, yet provide no shelter.</p>

        <h3>I. AGAINST THE ALGORITHM</h3>
        <p>We reject the feed. The feed is a river of sludge that washes away memory. We choose instead the <strong>Static Page</strong>—a fixed point in a turning world. It does not track you; it does not 'engage' you. It simply <em>is</em>.</p>

        <h3>II. THE BEAUTY OF THE LIMIT</h3>
        <p>A Low Entropy Citizen understands that power is found in restraint. We use the tools of our ancestors: Pure HTML. Pure CSS. No surveillance. No bloat.</p>
